# NOTE

1. There are 3 shard.bin files and 1 model.json file (Which contains our actual model) -> I have not uploaded here
2. I could not make it public, therefore I havent uploaded over here.
3. But, you can build/refer and add in same dir
4. The index.html used here was replaced with our Next.JS Website
5. The logic is same only the developement approach is unique.
6. The PPT contains video in the 2nd slide which in demo shows accuracy (0.4 means 40% and it means image is not real its spoofing)
7. Make sure to add model.json file here (TensorFlow)
